# School-C-Sharp
This repository is for my projects I did in school. I upload my code because it makes it easy to share to my classmates. Some code may have been generated by Github Copilot code completion.

 Most parts are can be seen written in Hungarian. That is because I am Hungarian.

 This code is made in Visual Studio Code using linux computers. If I didn't include: Console.ReadKey(); that is because I don't need it. I do however need Console.Clear(); to start off with a clean console.
